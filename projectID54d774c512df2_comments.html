<HTML><BODY>Best known for his magnificent fantasy castles and love for Wagner's grand operas, King Ludwig the second of Bavaria remains an enigmatic figure. Deposed of his royal title he died under mysterious circumstances. However, today, his extravagances are some of the best-known tourist attractions in Germany, and those who don't know (or at least seen a picture of) his fairy-tale castle Neuschwanstein near Fussen in Bavaria are hard to find. However, if you intend to visit that place (which is almost always crowded), don't forget to visit his (in my opinion) more charming palace Lindenhof and its magnificent surroundings.

<p>This book is a biography of King Ludwig, and will pose no particular difficulties while proofreading.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
